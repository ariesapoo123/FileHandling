“Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing except make music for us to enjoy. 
They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corn cribs, they don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. 
That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.” – Harper Lee, To Kill a Mockingbird
